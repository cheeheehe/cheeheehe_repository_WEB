        <h1>ðŸŽ€murderðŸŽ€</h1>
        <h2>& how to pull it off</h2>
        <h2>both quickly and efficiently!</h2>
        <p>just kidding. murder is wrong!</p>
        <p>don't do it.</p>
        <p><i>-a comprehensive argument on why:-</i></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>you won't get away with itðŸ§¸ðŸ©°</b></li>
                 <ol>â™¥unlike me, you are most likely a novice</ol>
                 <ol>â™¥practice does not make perfect here</ol>
            <li> have you considered baking?</li>
                <ol>â™¥cheescake tastes <u>delicious!</u></ol>
                <ol>â™¥however, dead bodies really <b>don't.</b> (trust me. personal experience.)</ol>
            <li>framing them is a more convenient method</li> 
                <ol><b>â™¥they will rot in jail ðŸŽ€</b></ol>
        </ul>
